# Random Forest Fetal Health Classification

This notebook uses the [Fetal Health dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/fetal-health-classification) from Kaggle to predict the health of a fetus. The dataset contains 2126 records of features extracted from Cardiotocogram exams.

I classify the health of the fetus using the following algorithms:
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine
